<h2>Fitness/Bodybuiling</h2>

    <p>
        I follow a morning routine with strength and mobility training.<br />
        When I do not have time to go to the actual gym I will wake up the same time and workout at home by bodyweighted exercises, maintaining poses for overall health and HIIT sessions.

<h2>Cycling</h2>

    <p> 
        I've been cycling since I was a kid, but it's only been a few years since it became a passion. I ride my bike every day, I've learned the basics to fix it, and my current bike is a personal project. <br />
        I also have a modified full-suspension all mountain/enduro MTB and bi-monthly I ride it, obviously, at mountain sides, conquering mountain peaks and roughly descend downhills. I think the adrenaline keeps me alive. <br />

<h2>Reading</h2>

<p>I likea to read Science-Fiction, as well as personal and financial growth books</p>
<hr />
<h2>Hiking</h2>

<p>
    Hiking is, for me, a disconnection from the urban environment.<br />
    I often hike mountain trails, peaks, but at a slower pace than riding my bike and whenever I found myself to the highest point of a mountain peak I always though "How great would it be if I had my bike to get down faster!". <br/>
    I also venture on foot through forests or quietly trails as a recreational habbit.
